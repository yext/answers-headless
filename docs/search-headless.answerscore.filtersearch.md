## AnswersCore.filterSearch() method

Performs a filtersearch request against specified fields within a single vertical.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
filterSearch(request: FilterSearchRequest): Promise<FilterSearchResponse>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  request | [FilterSearchRequest](./search-headless.filtersearchrequest.md) | filtersearch request options |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;[FilterSearchResponse](./search-headless.filtersearchresponse.md)<!-- -->&gt;

## Remarks

This differs from the vertical autocomplete because the vertical autocomplete operates on all entity fields whereas filtersearch operates only on specified fields. If rejected, the reason will be an [AnswersError](./search-headless.answerserror.md)<!-- -->.

## Example

A site has a 'products' vertical and would like a way to allow the user to narrow down the results by the product name. The site can add a second search bar powered by filtersearch which will include only product names as search suggestions.
